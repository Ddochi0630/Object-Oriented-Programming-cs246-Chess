# Object-Oriented-Programming-cs246-Chess

This is my chess project I developed with a partner in cs246 while in my 2A term at the University of Waterloo.
This project was developed in c++ featuring two levels of AI's for the computers and a graphical interface using X11. 
Player versus Player, Player versus Computer and Computer versus Computer games are possible.
Below are some pictures showing the UI
