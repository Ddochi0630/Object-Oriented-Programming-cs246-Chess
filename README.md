Chess Game 

Team: David Knight and Tom Ebergen

We developed this chess game in cs246 (University of Waterloo) as a final project.
 
Our chess game features two levels of difficulty for the computer AI and a graphical interface using X11. 
Player versus Player, Player versus Computer and Computer versus Computer games are possible.

All functionality from the Assignment specification was implemented except AI levels 3 and 4. We implemented extra features such as the ability to change the chess board pattern colours and piece colours. 

See the documentation for terminal commands for playing our game.
